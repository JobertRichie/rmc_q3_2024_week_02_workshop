# Introduction

This document compares the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) diseases burden for three countries: **Cameroon**, **Germany**, and **Malaysia**. These countries were chosen based on their location (Africa, Europe, and Asia) and level of income (low, middle, and high income) for better comparison.

We compared the burden due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNN), non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and overall disease burden for these countries.

The source data is from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study.
