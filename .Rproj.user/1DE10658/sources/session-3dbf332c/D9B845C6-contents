```{r}

# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table. 
ggplot(data = data_cmnn_mini,
       mapping = aes(x = Year,
                     y = Daly,
                     color = Entity)) +

## Summary of CMNN diseases burden findings

We observe that Germany has the lowest DALYs from 1990 to 2019, followed by Malaysia while Cameroon has the highest DALYs, in perfect correlation with their income: lower income countries having higher DALYs. From 1990 to 2019, the DALYs for Germany has broadly remained constant while that for Malaysia has slightly decreased. In Cameroon, the DALYs has greatly increased between 1990 and 2001 before a sharp decrease up to 2019.

## Cumulative CMNN diseases burden for the three countries over time

```{r}
data_cmnn_mini %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(cum_daly = sum(Daly)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,
             y = cum_daly)) +
  geom_line(color = "red",
            linewidth = 1,
            alpha = 0.9) +
  geom_point(color = "red",
             alpha = 0.9) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "DALYs lost",
       caption = "Source: Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study",
       title = "Cumulative trend in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) over time for 
Cameroon, Germany and Malaysia",
       subtitle = "Data for Communicable, Maternal, Neonatal and Nutritional diseases") 
```

The cumulative trend for the three countries shows an increasing burden from 1990 to 2001, then an exponential decrease up to 2019.
