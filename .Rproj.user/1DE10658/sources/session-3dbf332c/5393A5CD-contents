## Table of estimates for NCDs burden over time

```{r}

# You should pivot the data wider to show each country in a separate column.
data_ncd_wide <-

## Plot showing trends in NCDs burden over time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table. 
ggplot(data = data_ncd_mini,
       mapping = aes(x = Year,
                     y = Daly,
                     color = Entity)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1,
            alpha = 0.9) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "DALYs lost",
       caption = "Source: Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study",
       title = "Trends in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) over time for
Cameroon, Germany and Malaysia",

## Summary of NCDs burden findings

Mimicking the observation for CMNN diseases, Cameroon has the highest DALYs for NCD, followed by Malaysia and Germany with the lowest one, the situation remaining the same over time. In Cameroon, the DALYs increased from 1990 to 2002 before decreasing up to 2019. In Malaysia and Germany, there was an overall decreasing trend over time, with a fairly sharp decrease in Germany.

## Cumulative NCDs burden for the three countries over time

```{r}
data_ncd_mini %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(cum_daly = sum(Daly)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,
             y = cum_daly)) +
  geom_line(color = "red",
            linewidth = 1,
            alpha = 0.9) +
  geom_point(color = "red",
             alpha = 0.9) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "DALYs lost",
       caption = "Source: Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study",
       title = "Cumulative trend in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) over time for 
Cameroon, Germany and Malaysia",
       subtitle = "Data for Non-communicable diseases") 
```

The cumulative trend for NCD burden yields an overall sharp decreasing pattern over time.
