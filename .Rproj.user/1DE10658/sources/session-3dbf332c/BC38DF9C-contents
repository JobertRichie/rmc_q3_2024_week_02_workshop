## Table of estimates for overall diseases burden over time

```{r}

## Plot showing trends in overall diseases burden over time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table. 
ggplot(data = data_overall_mini,
       mapping = aes(x = Year,
                     y = Daly,
                     color = Entity)) +

## Summary of overalldDiseases burden findings

The burden due to CMNN diseases seem to be the major contributor to the overall diseases burden, as the trends for overall diseases mimics that for CMNN ones. DALYs for Germany is the lowest while that for Cameroon is the highest, this being the same over time. In Cameroon, the DALYs for overall diseases increased from 1990, peaked in 2002 and then decreased sharply until 2019. In Germany and Malaysia, there was a slight decrease over time. 

## Cumulative overall diseases burden for the three countries over time

```{r}
data_overall_mini %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(cum_daly = sum(Daly)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,
             y = cum_daly)) +
  geom_line(color = "red",
            linewidth = 1,
            alpha = 0.9) +
  geom_point(color = "red",
             alpha = 0.9) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "DALYs lost",
       caption = "Source: Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study",
       title = "Cumulative trend in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) over time for 
Cameroon, Germany and Malaysia",
       subtitle = "Data for overall diseases") 
```

Data point out a slight increasing trend from 1990 to 1999 when a peak was observed, then a decreasing trend until 2019.
